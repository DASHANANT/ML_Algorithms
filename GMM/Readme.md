# Gaussian Mixture models 

A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are
generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. 
One can think of mixture models as generalizing k-means clustering to incorporate information 
about the covariance structure of the data as well as the centers of the latent Gaussians.
