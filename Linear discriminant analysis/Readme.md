** Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), normal discriminant analysis (NDA), or discriminant function analysis is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant,
a method used in statistics and other fields, to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. 
The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification. **
